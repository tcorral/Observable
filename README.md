# observable-it
observable-it is a library to implement Observable Design Pattern in Browser
that only relays on top of the Event Browser API without implementing anything new
and most important without loops.

## Installation

### Node 

Dependencies:

* node >= 0.10
* npm >= 2.0.0

```bash
npm install observable-it --save
```

### Bower 

```bash
bower install observable-it --save
```

## Usage

### API:

#### Require:

```js
import Observer from './path/to/observable.js';
```

#### Constructor:

```js
import Observer from './path/to/observable.js';

var observer = new Observer();
``` 

#### Subscribe:

```js
import Observer from './path/to/observable.js';

var observer = new Observer();

observer.subscribe('my-event', function (event) {
    console.log('My Event is triggered');
});
``` 

#### Publish without passing data:

```js
import Observer from './path/to/observable.js';

var observer = new Observer();

observer.subscribe('my-event', function (event) {
    console.log('My Event is triggered');
});

observer.publish('my-event');
``` 

#### Publish passing data:

```js
import Observer from './path/to/observable.js';

var observer = new Observer();

observer.subscribe('my-event', function (event) {
    console.log('Data from publish:', event.detail);
});

observer.publish('my-event', { data: 'data-for-my-event' });
``` 

#### Publishing before subscribe:
observable-it will queue all the events when there is no subscribers to that event 
and when publish is done for this event, that event will be triggered.

```
You will never lose an event.
```

```js
import Observer from './path/to/observable.js';

var observer = new Observer();

observer.publish('my-event', { data: 'data-for-my-event' });

observer.subscribe('my-event', function (event) {
    console.log('Data from publish:', event.detail);
});
``` 

## Extending:
observable-it has been designed to extend from it as well, so that you
can easily convert your objects in observable objects too.

### Extending:
```js
import Observer from './path/to/observable.js';

class MyConstructor extends Observer {
    constructor() {
        super();
    }
}

export default MyConstructor;
``` 


To get more information I recommend to read the use cases in tests.

## Tests

To run the tests with QUnit:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
